  is attached to.

  balance change ups it to be considerably better for the duration/cooldown the ability has.
= Lowered hunger duration on Tainted Blade (Swords) Help make it stand out from Ares Blessing. Shorter/Smaller buff + Smaller punishment

1.1.6-ALPHA
+ Converted from .yml to SQL. Plugin size notably increased due to the library being used. This shouldn't have any notable effect on performance
+ Added a /mcconvert command (console only) to convert data from any prior versions to the new one. Please make sure no one logs on during conversion
+ New messages for the conversion command (auto updater will handle this one for ya ;))
=Rebalanced skills to award abilities earlier in the game and make the powering up take a bit longer. Will continually watch these values to see what
works best. To get the new values, delete the skills folder and let it regen.

1.1.5-ALPHA
= Was experimenting with code and forgot to remove some which threw a NullPointerError for a GUI. Is now fixed ;) More updates in the works

1.1.4-ALPHA
+ Redeemable exp and levels! Since many servers liked to offer exp and levels for mcmmo via buycraft or crates using external plugins, I decided to add native support to McRPG. It is all GUI based, with each GUI being customizable. In order to use redeemable exp or levels, players need to run /mcredeem %skill%. Some refinement might come in the near future including sound effects and such as well. Admin command and permissions will be added to the GitHub wiki shortly. Appropriate /mchelp info has been added into the en.yml file as well.
= Fixed some annoying bugs people had who downloaded 1.1.3 for the first install. There was a broken path in my auto config updaters that has now been repaired!

1.1.3-ALPHA
+ World Guard Scripting Support
+ Archery sounds and particles

1.1.2-ALPHA
+ AUTO UPDATING CONFIGS!
*Added option to change the worth of mobs from spawners and mob eggs

1.1.1-ALPHA
= Fixed issue with boss bar display not replacing placeholders when exp is gained

1.1.0-ALPHA
Note: All config changes can be made by deleting their files and letting them regen
+ Added Archery and 7 new abilities bringing current total to 35! Coming from mcMMO is Daze however it no
longer does extra damage, rather gives blindness, nausea and makes them look away. Puncture can inflict Bleed
and all modifiers from the Swords skill if you have any. Combo does more damage for consecutive shots. Tipped Arrows
allows normal arrows to deal a potion effect. Blessing Of Artemis will deal extra damage and give user invis. Blessing
of Apollo will give fire res, ignite target and burn away their buffs. Curse of Hades will deal many debuffs.

* Skills have been rebalanced for default exp values. Please consult github for new files or let the default files regen
