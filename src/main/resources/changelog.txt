1.1.0-ALPHA
Note: All config changes can be made by deleting their files and letting them regen
+ Added Archery and 7 new abilities bringing current total to 35! Coming from mcMMO is Daze however it no
longer does extra damage, rather gives blindness, nausea and makes them look away. Puncture can inflict Bleed
and all modifiers from the Swords skill if you have any. Combo does more damage for consecutive shots. Tipped Arrows
allows normal arrows to deal a potion effect. Blessing Of Artemis will deal extra damage and give user invis. Blessing
of Apollo will give fire res, ignite target and burn away their buffs. Curse of Hades will deal many debuffs.

* Skills have been rebalanced for default exp values. Please consult github for new files or let the default files regen
