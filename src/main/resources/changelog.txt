1.5.0-ALPHA
+ Added axes
= Improved UI. Default abilities now show in SubSkillGUI. Upgrade GUI now shows what skill is needed for upgrade
+ To add, go to editloadoutgui.yml and add %Skill% in the LevelPromptLore.
= Fixed bug with level up tips.
= Woodcutting abilities will only "ready" when looking at blocks. Axes will "ready" when looking at air or an entity. Looking into
a way to make this more generic.

1.4.0-ALPHA
+ Excavation added into the game
+ Weighted exp permissions

1.3.0-ALPHA
+ Fitness Skill is added into the game!
+ Upon request, added a Constant Exp Update section to the config.

1.2.5-ALPHA
+ Added a setting to forcibly display an actionbar update everytime a player gains exp
+ In the lang files, added a localization option for skill names. Commands will accept the english or custom version of the name
= Bug fixes with Poseidons Guardian

1.2.1-ALPHA - 1.2.4-ALPHA
=Minor bug fixes

1.2.0-ALPHA
+ Added Woodcutting Skill.
+ Added Posiedons Guardian for anti afk fishing
= Fixed a few SQL bugs that slipped through
= Moved WorldGuard support from config to wg_support.yml

1.1.6-ALPHA
+ Converted from .yml to SQL. Plugin size notably increased due to the library being used. This shouldn't have any notable effect on performance
+ Added a /mcconvert command (console only) to convert data from any prior versions to the new one. Please make sure no one logs on during conversion
+ New messages for the conversion command (auto updater will handle this one for ya ;))
=Rebalanced skills to award abilities earlier in the game and make the powering up take a bit longer. Will continually watch these values to see what
works best. To get the new values, delete the skills folder and let it regen.

1.1.5-ALPHA
= Was experimenting with code and forgot to remove some which threw a NullPointerError for a GUI. Is now fixed ;) More updates in the works

1.1.4-ALPHA
+ Redeemable exp and levels! Since many servers liked to offer exp and levels for mcmmo via buycraft or crates using external plugins, I decided to add native support to McRPG. It is all GUI based, with each GUI being customizable. In order to use redeemable exp or levels, players need to run /mcredeem %skill%. Some refinement might come in the near future including sound effects and such as well. Admin command and permissions will be added to the GitHub wiki shortly. Appropriate /mchelp info has been added into the en.yml file as well.
= Fixed some annoying bugs people had who downloaded 1.1.3 for the first install. There was a broken path in my auto config updaters that has now been repaired!

1.1.3-ALPHA
+ World Guard Scripting Support
+ Archery sounds and particles

1.1.2-ALPHA
+ AUTO UPDATING CONFIGS!
*Added option to change the worth of mobs from spawners and mob eggs
= Moved many ability events from the API to organize them better, should not break compatibility with QuestCreator
= Rebalanced some things with unarmed and mining. (Ice was broken AF!) Changed levels for abilities. Regenerate files for new info!

1.1.1-ALPHA
= Fixed issue with boss bar display not replacing placeholders when exp is gained

1.1.0-ALPHA
Note: All config changes can be made by deleting their files and letting them regen
+ Added Archery and 7 new abilities bringing current total to 35! Coming from mcMMO is Daze however it no
longer does extra damage, rather gives blindness, nausea and makes them look away. Puncture can inflict Bleed
and all modifiers from the Swords skill if you have any. Combo does more damage for consecutive shots. Tipped Arrows
allows normal arrows to deal a potion effect. Blessing Of Artemis will deal extra damage and give user invis. Blessing
of Apollo will give fire res, ignite target and burn away their buffs. Curse of Hades will deal many debuffs.

* Skills have been rebalanced for default exp values. Please consult github for new files or let the default files regen
