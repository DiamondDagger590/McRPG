# McRPG [![pipeline status](https://github.com/Eunoians/McRPG/workflows/Java%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Eunoians/McRPG/actions)

A new Skill and Ability experience for modern Minecraft. Featuring more than 70 abilities,
ranging from nostalgic ones from plugins such as McMMO to entirely new ones.

## For Developers

McRPG is an event driven plugin where everything is powered through a robust
API that allows for advanced configuration. Every ability requires events to be
activated and is part of the code structure we plan to adhere to. The reasoning behind
this is to enforce a certain coding standard for our plugin along with any addons that may
be released.
